Digital-Logic-Circuit-sSmulator-

I’m excited to share a project I’ve been working on: a Digital Logic Circuit Simulator built using C++! 💻✨

This simulator allows users to visualize and test basic gates (AND, OR, XOR, etc.), Half-Adders, Full-Adders, and even verify Boolean Algebra laws through live truth tables. It’s been a fantastic way to deepen my understanding of low-level logic and software architecture.

This project was a true collaborative effort. I worked closely with my teammate @Manahil Shazad, and we both played equal roles in bringing this logic to life.

A special thanks to our teacher, @Waqas Ali, for the guidance and support throughout this semester.
